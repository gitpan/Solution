=head1 NAME

Solution - A Simple, Stateless Template System

=head1 Synopsis

    use Solution;

    my $template = Solution::Template->new( );
    $template->parse( # See Solution::Tag for more
        '{%for x in (1..3) reversed %}{{x}}, {%endfor%}{{some.text}}'
    );
    print $template->render( { some => { text => 'Contact!' } } );

=head1 Description

L<Solution|/"Ugh! Why a new Top Level Namespace?"> is a template engine based
on Liquid. The Liquid template engine was crafted for very specific
requirements:

=over 4

=item * It has to have simple markup and beautiful results. Template engines
which don't produce good looking results are no fun to use.

=item * It needs to be non-evaling and secure. Liquid templates are made so
that users can edit them. You don't want to run code on your server which your
users wrote.

=item * It has to be stateless. The compile and render steps have to be
separate, so that the expensive parsing and compiling can be done once; later
on, you can just render it by passing in a hash with local variables and
objects.

=item * It needs to be able to style emails as well as HTML.

=back

=head1 Getting Started

It's very simple to get started with L<Solution|Solution>. Just as in Liquid,
templates are built and used in two steps: Parse and Render.

For an overview of the Liquid/Solution syntax, please read
Liquid for Designers (it's linked to in the L<See Also|Solution/"See Also">
section below).

    # Parses and compiles the template
    my $template = Solution::Template->parse('Hi, {{name}}!');

    # Renders the output => "Hi, Sanko!"
    $template->render({ name => 'Sanko' });

The C<parse> step creates a fully compiled template which can be re-used as
often as you like. You can store it in memory or in a cache for faster
rendering later.

All parameters you want L<Solution> to work with have to be passed as
parameters to the render method. L<Solution> is a closed ecosystem; it does
not know about your local, instance, and global variables.

For more, see L<Solution::Tag>.

=head1 Why should I use Solution?

=over 4

=item * You want to allow your users to edit the appearance of your
application, but don't want them to run insecure code on your server.

=item * You want to render templates directly from the database.

=item * You like Smarty-style template engines.

=item * You need a template engine which does HTML just as well as emails.

=item * You don't like the markup language of your current template engine.

=item * You wasted three days reinventing this wheel when you could have been
doing something productive like volunteering or catching up on past seasons of
I<Doctor Who>.

=back

=head1 Why shouldn't I use Solution?

=over 4

=item * You've found or written your own template engine which fills your
needs better than Liquid or Solution ever could.

Psst! Hey, if you haven't found it yet, check the
L<See Also|Solution/"Other Template Engines"> section.

=item * You are uncomfortable with text that you didn't copy and paste
yourself. Everyone knows computers cannot be trusted.

=back

=head1 Ugh! Why a new Top Level Namespace?

I really don't have a good reason but I promise to send myself to bed without
dinner as punishment.

As I understand it, the original project's name, Liquid, is a reference to the
classical states of matter (the engine itself being stateless). I settled on
L<Solution|Solution> because it's Liquid but... with... bits of other stuff
floating in it. Pretend you majored in chemistry instead of mathematics or
computer science and you'll know what I mean.

This 'solution' is B<not> the answer to all your problems. ...I'll even go
ahead and say it's not the best solution for your templating problems. It's
simply I<a> solution.

=head2 Other Template Engines

=over

=item * The L<Template Toolkit|Template> is the granddaddy of all Perl based
template engines.

=item * ...which would make L<Template::Tiny|Template::Tiny> the weird uncle.
